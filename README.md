# INCUNAE

INCUNAE is an application for transcribing old texts written in Fraktur and Schwabacher (16th–17th century). Transcribing these kinds of typefaces is particularly difficult and tedious. There is good solution to this problem called <a href="https://lite.transkribus.eu/" target="_blank">Transkribus</a> – “a comprehensive platform for the digitisation, AI-powered text recognition, transcription, and searching of historical documents”. It's a great tool but has one big downside: recognition is only server-side, and you often have to wait in a queue. I decided to create a front-end application that solves this problem. INCUNAE is using the Tesseract OCR engine port (<a href="https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js#tesseractjs" target="_blank">tesseract.js</a> ) with various recognition models for Fraktur and Schwabacher. It’s not perfect, but works just fine if you need to quickly transcribe and edit old text.

It's a hobby project, not at all comparable to Transkribus and not as helpful, but if you have a moment, you can check it out <a href="https://johnniego.github.io/INCUNAE/" target="_blank">here</a>.
